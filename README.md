# eInvoice REST API Framework Documentation

This repo is legacy, content has been refactored into other places in
[https://github.com/ausdigital/](https://github.com/ausdigital/).
This includes [billing-semantics](https://github.com/ausdigital/billing-semantics)
and [ausdigital](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital.github.io) web site,
[access-point](https://github.com/ausdigital/access-point) protocol as well as the following
individual components:

 * [metadata-publisher](https://github.com/ausdigital/metadata-publisher)
 * [notary](https://github.com/ausdigital/notary)
 * [identity-provider](https://github.com/ausdigital/identity-provider)
 * [capability-locator](https://github.com/ausdigital/capability-locator)

The ticket system remains here, including some open tickets that cut across repositories. 
[Ticket 6](https://github.com/ausdigital/RESTful-framework/issues/6) contains a lengthy
discussion that provides context for the refactor to multiple repositories.
